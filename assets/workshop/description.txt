[h1]Death Log by Konijima[/h1]

Keep track of every player's demise with the Player Death Logging mod! This handy server-side tool records detailed information about each character's death in a dedicated server file. Analyze the data to discover trends, identify problem areas, and even commemorate fallen heroes. Make every death count, and gain valuable insights for your server community!

The log file can be found in your server in the lua directory.
